                            <p>So as I told all of you, this is a very rough overview. Certain parts are fleshed out more than others because there are very specific things i wanted to say to my sister so that I did not overlook them. However, the vast majority of it is just bullet points so that I can remember to bring it up. I add the color later during the course of our conversations. So, if any of you read this, and would like to ask specific questions or engage on comments and conversation, let's do it! ampamp;amp;#x2. it must constantly be borne in mind that the constellation of archetypal images and fantasies is not in itself pathological. The pathological element only reveals itself in the way the individual reacts to them and how he interprets them. The characteristic feature of a pathological reaction is, above all, identification with the archetype. This produces a sort of inflation and possession by the emergent contents, so that they pour out in a torrent which no therapy can stop. Identificatio. I won’t go into detail - you can read about the experience here (https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/82s4aj/full_body_orgasm_meditating/)), but a week ago I had a bizarre experience while high on cannabis that, upon subsequent research, seems to be conceptualised as a Kundalini Experience. Full of intense bodily sensations to the dissolution of the body, it culminated in a hands free orgasm and a complete sense of ego death. Essentially, it felt like breaking into a previous DMT hypers. This post will concentrate on Rasputin, why he bears the name that can not be killed, his role in the collapse and his ties to the Brays. My previous posts tie into this in a few facets and I am going to borrow from it heavily. I believe the game is based on the Gnostic theologies and the Myth of The Fall of The Mother Goddess. (What is important from this is that I believe that The Traveler is a being known as the Demiurge and its Mother is the Darkness from which it stole the Light Part 1 can be found here:https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/7rauol/the_nine_the_traveler_and_the_flower_eater_pt_1/?utm_content=thumbnailamputm_medium=hotamputm_source=redditamputm_name=DestinyLore The Third Key: Perfection There exists within mankind a myth that has been suppressed through the beginning of recorded time. Religious history has obscured and destroyed most original texts relating to it and persecuted those that taught it. The Aeon Exotics led me to Gnosticism. So lately I've been revisiting Warhammer 1 and all of the factions I never really paid proper attention to-- Clan Angrund was one of them and the playthrough has easily been one of my most fun ever. Particularly now that I'm in the late game, and have finally emerged victorious from a Dwarven Civil War as the Old World's only standing superpower. Just wrote up this summary to describe how it all happened, and it gets progressively more AAR and RP-flavory as it goes, becoming a real epic story. Recommended Listening. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqWdZYnq0U) Jason! Watch out! I yell into his mind to get his attention, and he turns to look where I indicated, but- _PIFF._ A sound much like a balloon popping fills the room, and Jason's head is knocked backward. I can only stare in stunned silence as he falls to the ground. My still-invisible orb flops out of the shoulder-wrapped gurney at his side and rolls a few feet away, but nobody notices. Jason. Jason! 
I awaken to another day of suffering within this precipice dungeon. Upon father’s enraged whim, I was banished to this cramped and musty mew innumerous days ago and the vulgarity I’ve endured during my time here feels eternal and unholy and is consummate in its brutality. A sickening detachment from the world I knew coalesces into rolling pearls of sweat across my skin and there’s a fear within that is more trapped than I am. I imagine that this is certainly akin to Hell for those of ill-grace. _Dammit! Why did Amelia leave? Where did she go?_ A spark of worry goes through my mind as I warily look from Satan over to the spot she was sitting. _What's that hole? I might be overthinking things. but I'm worried about her. I can't help myself._ Satan begins stretching and pops his vertebrae. "Mmm, aah, that's the good stuff right there. Well, I'm a demon of my word, Jason. You successfully managed to not only render me naked with that ferocious attack ### The Espada ( The Espada are a group of 10 exceptionally powerful and gifted Arrancar under the direction of Sosuke Aizen, whose sole purpose is to help him wipe out the Gotei 13 and crown himself The Soul King to rule over creation. Created via the removing of their Hollow masks with the assistance of Aizen's Hogyoku ( the Espada were not powerful enough before joining Aizen to even pose a threat to such powerful fighters. Author Note: I rewrote this part on April 14th, 2018. If you don't see this message in a future part, then it has yet to be fixed, and I apologize for prose/character/story inconsistencies. You can find the original parts as I first wrote them over a year ago on /r/klokinator.  _Dammit! Where's Amelia? Why did she leave?_ A spark of worry goes through my mind as I warily look from Satan over to the spot she was sitting. _The dirt is disturbed. Continuation of this. (https://www.reddit.com/r/tgrp/comments/5xkruc/arc_spotlight_awaken/dfmt0aw/) A grim frown darkened Liao’s visage. As yet another testament to his speed and agility, her opponent spun away from her attack, shifting away from her field of vision - not that anything could be seen within the thick dust anyway. It didn’t take a lot of thinking to know what was coming next. He was surely going for an opportune attack. It was the natural decision for any seasoned fighter.

I think for future Events we should try to give suggestions on improving boss battles like Diretide and the year beast. I think its very important that Valve limits the hero pool, there is always some component that valve didn't consider. If the hero pool was limited like in Wraith Night it can be checked more easily. Now for the bossfight itself as many people have complained the Flame Ingots are to important and as a casual player you will not have been able to farm not nearly enough Update Notes - Closed Beta Patch 1 Lore Fixed a journal inaccuracy and made it clear Nexus orbits a trinary star system. Tutorials The challenge tutorial has been updated to reflect the new reward track system. World Bosses Most of the large scale 20-man bosses on Nexus now have a system in place that allows players to force spawn them. Gargantua Lethargic debuff now functions properly.

Which is very sad because past champions used to have very very intricately and beautifully written lores using fascinating words. I always felt like reading champion lore was like another English class for me. Definitely learned a lot from the authors. And just few hours ago, I bumped in to Gnarsies' video on the lack of nicely written lore. And stumbled upon Tom Abernathy's statement about making strong characters and not interesting lore. </p>
