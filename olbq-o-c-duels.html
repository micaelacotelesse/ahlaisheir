H i, its me, again, notroyalfan, and I, want, to, make, a, THE CHALLANGE season, o K A y, buUuUUUuuuUuuuUUUUUUUUUUUT, there is a TWIST!!!!!11!! The person who loses the duel, dies!! That's a nice twist. Ahem, now, i suppose this is a uh, some kind of killing duel game, so yeah, 20 people will compete for money, but they can die, but no one would sign up for that, so of course, i'm not gonna put that people might die, when they sign up, it will be already too late to regret it, heheh. I've rewatched this episode about 4 times now and just as I was on the first watch, on the second watch, third watch, fourth watch ,I'm certain. I've come to a conclusion. Only a character that was not on The Night King's Radar at all could've possibly killed him. Here is why: Throughout the Episode The Long Night  The Night King keeps away from the battle until victory is all but assured. The people complaining about Arya killing him have completely ignored the context of the episode. how many times was it a glorious duel or battle as one would hope/expect a major player would go out? Especially looking back at characters that held great power and/or were good fighters: Ned Stark: beheaded as a traitor after being imprisoned after losing a swordfight because a guard intervened. Khal Drogo: Almost dying to a minor infection, then turned into a vegetable, then suffocated by Dany out of mercy. Renly Baratheon: Stabbed in the back by a shadowdemon. If two like-minded adults possessing the full mental capacity to make their own decisions choose to settle a dispute by fighting to the death with either pistols, swords, or knives it should be their absolute legal right to do so. As long as both parties knowingly and willingly consent to duel, there should be no legal repercussions for engaging in dueling. The prevailing duelist should not face criminal or civil charges for vanquishing their foe. If made legal, dueling parties shall be required. 
You can change the red vs green color pallet for the factions in battle. Stop bitching about this You can refuse all duels. Stop bitching about spamming duels Shogun 2 and medieval were good total war games. but seriously trying to say they are better than a brand new polished and complex total war game comes across very pretentious. If you deploy a line of spears in front of a line of archers every game and smash your lines together without any maneuvering or strategy For fuck's sake Rockstar! The singleplayer made me cry tears of sadness and joy. But the online. I'm level 128 and my soul feels empty every time I log on or off. WE ARE NOT THE SAME PLAYERBASE AS GTA5. We want to free roam. We want the camp to feel like a real camp. We want to purchase a homestead. We want to hire NPC's to work the homestead. We want wagons to carry our pelts. We want the trapper. We want to rob people. We want more clothes, not everybody in 1898 looked like a cowboy!

Any man who should slaughter a lute player should be considered a criminal, and instantly be put to death by his enemies or his allies. Consider not kicking a man who would end these criminals, for he has Honour and is Just. The Mortal kombat theme on a lute is beautiful , and is the perfect tune to wade into battle against thy foe.

Edit: Holy smokes, thank you guys so much for the Silver, Gold, and Platinum awards. It means a lot, and I'm elated that people appreciate this post that much! ___ Hey, I don't like rambling on about this topic too much because I've already discussed it so many times when it gets brought up, but by this point I'm inclined to make a case about Thrall's Mak'gora because I've just seen Bellular's recent video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loP-d-Zckok) where he propagates ### Cubs (25-15) @ Reds (19-24) First Pitch: 5:40 PM at Great American Ball Park Pitcher TV Radio - - - - Cubs (/r/ChiCubs) Jose Quintana ( (4-2, 3.50 ERA) NBCSCH WSCR Reds (/r/Reds) Luis Castillo ( (4-1, 1.76 ERA) FSO WLW MLB Fangraphs Brooks Baseball Reddit Stream IRC Chat Channel Finder :-: :-: :-: :-: :-: :-: Gameday (https://www.mlb.com/gameday/565240) Game Graph (http://www.fa. It's been one hell of a ride thus far, and it's only been 7 days. None of us would've expected this reception in our wildest dreams. As of today MORDHAU has sold just shy of 500.000 copies and we have reached a concurrent peak of 60.000 concurrent players yesterday. These are just mindblowing numbers to us, and we still haven't fully realized that MORDHAU is currently among the top played games on Steam. Unfortunately the launch wasn't as smooth as we had hoped. Server performance was abysmal. 
Met this cool person on Dark Souls the other night. Really fun to PvP with, didn't gank me if others invaded, and we had honor with our duels/spars. a real rare kinda person that you just don't find in Dark Souls. Anyways, so I want to know when this person is on so that way I can hop on too so I add him/her to my friends. Well my friend is on tonight, but isn't spawning for PvP so I am assuming that they are in another area. I so badly wanna be able to message them and find out where Since the previous official tier list was taken down, I decided to make my own tierlist to ensure this accurate resource of knowledge remains available for all players. The spread of knowledge from players with tournament experience is required for this community to grow. I discussed with a lot of competitive players on their thoughts on the placements of heroes as well as mine, and put together a comprehensive tier list for duels, dominion, and brawls, with hero descriptions and tier list descr. https://makingstarwars.net/2019/04/huge-rumor-about-how-the-final-duel-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-plays-out/. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I feel like the HBO version of Arya Stark has really gone hill starting around season 5. I've been rewatching season 7 to get ready for 8, and especially in this season the character is just cringeworthy to me. I don't believe this is the fault of Maisie Williams, shes wonderful, but rather some shoddy writing/directing. Her lines come off like they were written by a 14 year old edgelord and she seems to have gotten profoundly stupid for some reason.

Alright, so these are some rambling thoughts and in no way I mean to incense the good ole imperial vs. stormcloak debate! I'm just genuinely curious as to why is this, and if I'm missing some important piece to the whole tirade. So. Ulfric and Torygg. The first goes to Solitude and stomps his angry way in to the Blue Palace, in order to issue a challenge in the old ways against the High King. Torygg is forced to accept, and everyone and their mother knows "Katarina is a rough-edged loner who stays far away from the politics of Durandal Academy.
